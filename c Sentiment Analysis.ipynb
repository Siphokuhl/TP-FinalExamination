    "Data Colection\n",
    "Gather employee feedback data , which can include open-ended survey responses, comments or review. Ensure the data is collected in a format suitable for analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing the Text\n",
    "Remove any irrelavant charecters such as punctuations special symbols and numbers to focus on the actual words\n",
    "convert all text to lowercase to ensure unifomity\n",
    "Break the text into individuals words or token making it easier to analyze\n",
    "Remove common words thst do not contribute significantly to the sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Extraction\n",
    "Bag of words- Create a representation of the text data by counting the frequency of each word across all feedback . Tis approach focuses solely on word occurence\n",
    "Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency- This method accounts for how often a word appears in a adocument realtive to its frequency in the entire dataset, providing more weigth to unique words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Abalysis Techniques\n",
    "Lexicon-Based Approaches - Utilize pre-defined sentiment lexicons that classify words or phrases as posistive ,negative or neutral. By matching words in the feedback with these lexicons you can compute an overall sentiment core.\n",
    "Machine Learning model - Train classifier (Naive bays, Logistic Rergression) on labeled data, wher the sentiment of feedback is already kwown. The model learns to predict the sentiment of new unseen feedback based on features extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning Approach- More advanced technique such as using recurrent Neural Network (RNNS) or Transfomers like(BERT) , can capture the context and nuances in the text, often yielding better results for sentiment classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorize\n",
    "-Based on the sentiment analysis results , categorize the feedback into\n",
    "-positive: Indicates satisfaction, praise,or good experience with the Two Ports system\n",
    "-Negative: Reflects dissatistction , complaints or negative experience\n",
    "-Neutral: Feedback that does not strongly express a positive or nagetive sentiment\n",
    "nEvaluation\n",
    "-Assess the accuracy and reliability of the sentiment analysis through the metrics like precision, recall and F1 score especially if you used a machine learning approach. This ensures the Models effectiveness in categorizing sentiment corretly. \n",
    "Visualization and Reporting \n",
    "-Create visual represantation (like pi chart or bar graphs) to summarize the proportion of each sentiment category. This hepls stakeholders quiclky understand employee sentiment towards Two-Portsizng overall employee satisfaction."
